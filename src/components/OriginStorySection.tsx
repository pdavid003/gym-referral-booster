              <p>
                My gym was bleeding money. Every month, I watched the bank account shrink while competitors thrived.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I tried everything...

                THE BREAKING POINT
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                One Tuesday morning, I counted only 7 people in the gym during peak hours. Seven. My biggest competitor across town was packed.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I sat in my empty office and did the math. At this rate, we had maybe 3 months left.
              </p>
              
              <p className="font-medium">
                That's when I noticed something strange...
              </p>
              
              <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8 border-l-4 border-blue-500">
                <p className="mb-2">My happiest members never brought friends. Ever.</p>
                <p>Sarah had lost 40 pounds and looked amazing. But she never referred anyone.</p>
                <p>Mike had gained serious muscle and confidence. Still no referrals.</p>
                <p className="mt-2 font-medium">These people loved my gym. They told me constantly. But they weren't telling anyone else.</p>
              </div>
              
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
                THE DISCOVERY
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                I started asking members directly. <span className="font-medium">"Why don't you bring friends?"</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The answers shocked me:
              </p>
              
              <div className="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-3 my-8">
                <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100">
                  <p className="italic text-gray-700">"I don't want to seem pushy..."</p>

                <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100">
                  <p className="italic text-gray-700">"What if they don't like it?"</p>
                </div>
                <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100">
                  <p className="italic text-gray-700">"I'm not good at sales..."</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              
              <p>
                My members had invisible barriers in their heads. They wanted to help but felt blocked.
              </p>
              
              <p className="font-medium">
                That's when I realized the truth...

                THE REAL PROBLEM
              </h3>
              
              <p className="text-lg">
                The fitness industry had it backwards. We were trying to make members into salespeople instead of removing what stopped them from sharing naturally.
              </p>
              
              <p className="my-6">
                I spent the next 6 months studying psychology, behavioral economics, and social dynamics. I tested different approaches with my remaining members.
              </p>
              
              <p className="font-medium">
                Slowly, something amazing happened...
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Members started bringing friends. Not because I pushed them. Because sharing felt natural again.

                I began teaching my system to a few friends in the industry.

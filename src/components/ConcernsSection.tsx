                <p>
                  I get it. You've been burned before by promises that didn't deliver.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But here's the thing... referral programs aren't magic. They're psychology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When someone loves your gym, they naturally want to share it. We just make that sharing systematic and rewarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The data backs this up. Referred members stay 37% longer than other members. They spend 25% more on average.
                </p>
                <p className="font-medium text-primary-600">
                  This isn't theory. It's proven science.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 sm:p-8 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-primary-600 mb-4">
                "What if I implement this system and it doesn't work for my gym?"
              </h3>
              <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-600">
                <p>
                  Fair question. Every gym is different.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That's why we built flexibility into the system. You can adapt it to your specific situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  
                  
                </p>
                <p className="font-medium text-primary-600">
                  But here's what I really think will happen... You'll see your first referrals within the first two weeks.
                </p>

            </div>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-primary-600 mb-4">
                "I can't afford to invest more money right now. My budget is already tight."
              </h3>
              <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
                <p>
                  I understand money is tight. Running a gym isn't cheap.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But think about this... How much are you spending on marketing that isn't working?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Facebook ads that don't convert. Google ads that drain your budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This system costs less than one month of ineffective advertising.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And unlike ads, referrals keep working even when you're not paying for them.
                </p>
                <p className="font-medium text-primary-600">
                  One new member pays for the entire system. Everything after that is pure profit.

                "My staff is already overwhelmed. We don't have time for another system."

                <p>
                  Your staff will love this system once they see how it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instead of chasing leads that go nowhere, they'll be welcoming pre-qualified referrals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People who already want to join because their friend recommended you.

                  The system actually makes their job easier, not harder.

                  This concern comes up a lot. But here's what we've found...

                <p>
                  Happy members WANT to help their friends get fit. They just need the right encouragement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you make it easy and rewarding, participation rates soar.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our clients typically see 60-80% of members participate within the first month.
